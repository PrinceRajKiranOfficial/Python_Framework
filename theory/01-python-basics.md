## Introduction

Python is one of the most popular and versatile programming languages in the world today. This module covers the fundamental concepts that form the foundation for web development with Flask.

## What is Python?

**Python** is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language known for its simple syntax and exceptional readability.

### Core Characteristics

- **High-Level**: Abstracts away complex hardware details
- **Interpreted**: Code is executed line by line
- **General-Purpose**: Suitable for various domains
- **Open Source**: Freely available and community-driven

## Key Features

### Simple and Readable Syntax
Python's syntax is designed to be intuitive and English-like, making it accessible for beginners while remaining powerful for experts.

```python
# Example of Python's readable syntax
def greet_user(name):
    if name:
        return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to Python."
    else:
        return "Hello, Guest! Welcome to Python."
```

### Dynamic Typing
Variables don't require explicit type declarations:

```python
message = "Hello World"  # String
count = 42              # Integer
price = 19.99           # Float
is_active = True        # Boolean
```

## Why Choose Python?
