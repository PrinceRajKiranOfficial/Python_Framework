4. What is a Django Model?
Definition
A Django Model is a Python class that represents a database table.
What Happens Behind Scené?
When we write:
class Post (models.MQdeU) :
title
111QdeLs.CharEieXd(max length=200)
Django understands:
CREATE TABLE post (
title VARCHAR (200)
& Students don't write SQL, Django does it.
